    "# Object-oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming is one of the most common ways to write and structure software. In object-oriented programming you write classes that represent real-world things and situations, and you create objects based on these classes. When you write a class, you define the general\n",
    "behavior that a whole category of objects can have. When you create individual objects from the class, each object is automatically equipped with the general behavior; you can then give each object whatever unique traits you desire. \n",
    "\n",
    "Making an object from a class is called *instantiation*, and you work with instances of a class. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating and Using a Class\n",
    "\n",
    "You can model almost anything using classes. Let’s start by writing a simple class, `Book`, that represents a book and its contents—not one book in particular, but any book. What do we know about most books? Well, they likely all have a *title* an *author*, and contain some *chapters*. We also know that you can *read* books and *open* them to inspect them further. Those two pieces of information (title and author) and those two behaviors (read and open) will be constituents of our Book class because they are common to most books. After our class is written, we will use it to create individual instances, each of which represents one specific book.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating the Book Class\n",
    "\n",
    "Each instance created from the Book class will store a `title` an `author`, and its `chapters`, and we will give each book the 'ability' to get `read()` and to get opened `open_book()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The __init__() Method\n",
    "\n",
    "A function that’s part of a class is a *method*. Everything you learned about functions applies to methods as well; the only practical difference for now is the way we will call methods. The `__init__()` method is a special method Python runs automatically whenever we create a new instance based on the `Book` class. This method has two leading underscores and two trailing underscores, a convention that helps prevent Python’s default method names from conflicting with your method names.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define the `__init__()` method to have four parameters: `self`, `title`, `author`, and `chapters=`. The `self` parameter is **required** in the method definition, and it must come **first** before the other parameters. It must be included in the definition because when Python calls this `__init__()` method later (to create an instance of `Book`), the method call will automatically pass the `self` argument. Every method call associated with a class automatically passes `self`, which\n",
    "is a reference to the instance itself; it gives the individual instance access to the attributes and methods in the class. When we make an instance of `Book`, Python will call the `__init__()` method from the `Book` class. We will pass `Book()` a `title`, an `author`, and `chapters=` as arguments; `self` is passed automatically, so we do not need to pass it. Whenever we want to make an instance from the`Book` class, we will provide values for only the last three parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three variables defined each have the prefix `self`. Any variable prefixed with `self` is available to every method in the class, and we will also be able to access these variables through any instance created from the class. `self.title = title` takes the value stored in the parameter name and stores it in the variable name, which is then attached to the instance being created. Variables that are accessible through instances like this are called attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Book` class has two other methods: `read` and `open`. The instances we create later will have access to these methods."

    "\n",
    "We tell Python to create a book whose title is `'The Book of Silence'` and whose author is `'Nobody'`. When Python reads the line, `silent_book = Book('The Book of Silence', 'Nobody')` it calls the `__init__()` method in `Book` with the arguments `'The Book of Silence'` and `'Nobody'`. The `__init__()` method creates an instance representing this particular book and sets the `author` and `title` attributes using the values we provided. The `__init__()` method has no explicit return statement, but Python automatically returns an instance representing this book. We store that instance in the variable `empty_book`. The *naming convention* is helpful here: we can usually assume that a capitalized name like `Book` refers to a class, and a lowercase name like `empty_book` refers to a single instance created from a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Accessing Attributes\n",

    "The string returned by `__repr__` should be unambiguous and, if possible, **match the source code necessary to recreate the object** being represented. That is why our chosen representation looks like calling the constructor of the class, e.g. `Book('The Book of Silence', 'Nobody', [])`.\n",

    "As an example, let’s model a comic book. A comic book is just a specific kind of book, with less text and more images :). Consequently, we can base our new `ComicBook` class on the `Book` class we wrote earlier. Then we’ll only have to write code for the attributes and behavior specific to comic books.\n",

It tells Python to call the `__init__()` method from `ComicBook`’s parent class, which gives a `ComicBook` instance all the attributes of its parent class.

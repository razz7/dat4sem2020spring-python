    "# Reading from a File\n",

    "An incredible amount of data is available in text files. Text files can contain weather data, traffic data, socioeconomic data, literary works, and more. Reading from a file is particularly useful in data analysis applications, but it’s also applicable to any situation in which you want to analyze or modify information stored in a file. For example, you can write a program that reads in the contents of a text file and rewrites the file with formatting that allows a browser to display it.\n",

    "Let’s start by looking at the `open() function`. To do any work with a file, even just printing its contents, you first need to open the file to access it. The `open()` function needs one argument: the name of the file you want to open. Python looks for this file in the directory where the program that is currently being executed is stored. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `open()` function returns an object representing the file. Here, `open('pi_30_digits.txt')` returns an object representing `pi_30_digits.txt`. Python stores this object in `file_object`, which we will work with later in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "The keyword `with` denotes a *Context Manager*, which essentially wraps a block of code and performs an action at the end of the block, no matter how it exits. In this case, it closes the file once access to it is no longer needed. Notice how we call `open()` in this program but not `close()`. You could open and close the file by calling `open()` and `close()`, but if a bug in your program prevents the `close()` statement from being executed, the file may never close. This may seem trivial, but improperly closed files can cause data to be lost or corrupted. And if you call `close()` too early in your program, you’ll find yourself trying to work with a closed file (a file you can’t access), which leads to more errors. It is not always easy to know exactly when you should close a file, but with the structure shown here, Python will figure that out for you. All you have to do is open the file and work with it as desired, trusting that Python will close it automatically when the time is right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have a file object representing `pi_30_digits.txt`, we use the `read()` method in the second line of our program to read the entire contents of the file and store it as one long string in contents. When we print the value of contents, we get the **entire** text file back.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only difference between this output and the original file is the extra blank line at the end of the output. The blank line appears because `read()` returns an empty string when it reaches the end of the file; this empty string shows up as a blank line. If you want to remove the extra blank line, you can use `rstrip()`."

    "\n",

    "The `json` module allows you to dump simple Python data structures into a file and load the data from that file the next time the program runs. You can also use `json` to share data between different Python programs. Even better, the JSON data format is not specific to Python, so you can share data you store in the JSON format with people who work in many other programming languages. It is a useful and portable format, and it is easy to learn.\n",

    "## The CSV File Format\n",
    "\n",
    "One simple way to store data in a text file is to write the data as a series of values separated by commas, called comma-separated values. The resulting files are called CSV files. \n",
    "For example, here are two lines of population data from Copenhagen data in CSV format:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csv\n",
    "2015,1,0,5100,614\n",
    "2015,1,0,5104,2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is population data from Copenhagen City with respect to year 2015. It includes the year of reference (2015 in first column), a code for the neighborhood of the city, the age of the corresponding citizens, a code of their nationality, and finally the amount of persons of that nationality and age.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is described in more detail here: http://data.kk.dk/dataset/befolkningen-efter-ar-bydel-alder-og-statsborgerskab\n",
    "and the nationality codes are detailed here: http://www.dst.dk/da/Statistik/dokumentation/Times/forebyggelsesregistret/statkode.aspx\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "CSV files are simple. For example, CSV files\n",
    "  * Do not have types for their values—everything is a string\n",
    "  * Do not have settings for font size or color\n",
    "  * Do not have multiple worksheets\n",
    "  * Cannot specify cell widths and heights\n",
    "  * Cannot have merged cells\n",
    "  * Cannot have images or charts embedded in them\n",
    "  \n",
    "The advantage of CSV files is simplicity. CSV files are widely supported by many types of programs, can be viewed in text editors, and are a straightforward way to represent spreadsheet data. The CSV format is exactly as advertised: It is just a text file of comma-separated values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**OBS:** Since CSV files are just text files, you might be tempted to read them in as a string and then process that string using the techniques you learned above. For example, since each cell in a CSV file is separated by a comma, maybe you could just call the `split()` method on each line of text to get the values, see below. But not every comma in a CSV file represents the boundary between two cells. CSV files also have their own set of escape characters to allow commas and other characters to be included as part of the values. The `split()` method does not handle these escape characters. Because of these potential pitfalls, you should always use the `csv` module for reading and writing CSV files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, do not do the following in practice! It is just for visualization!"

    "\n",
    "The `writerow()` method for Writer objects takes a list argument. Each value in the list is placed in its own cell in the output CSV file. The return value of `writerow()` is the number of characters written to the file for that row (including newline characters). Notice how the Writer object automatically escapes the comma in the value `'614,5'` with double quotes in the CSV file. The `csv` module saves you from having to handle these special cases yourself."
